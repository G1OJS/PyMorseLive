## Installation
This isn't a package yet so ....

Copy both morse_get_OOK.py and audio.py into a folder, edit the keywords specifying the audio input at the top (CABLE and or RIG & make sure the one you want is specified in the __init__ line). Open morse_get_OOK.py in your favourite IDE and run as main.
